# Project-1-DJPlayn Project

## Description
With this project, we came up with an idea for a project and worked with the group, to create branches in GitHub and worked with each other to work on our own versions of the project program. Then we pushed the versions to the GiThub branches and created pull requests to the main and pushed our versions to the main in GitHub.
